# PRAM Algorithms
Parallel Random Acess Machine is a model for parallel machines which uses any of these following R/W operations:

- Exclusive Read (ER)
- Exclusive Write (EW)
- Concurrent Read (CR)
- Concurrent Write (CR)

This repository contains some algorithms using this model:

- CREW Array Sum
- EREW Array Sum

Each folder contains the C code and a Markdown file which contains the pseudocode for the algorithm.
